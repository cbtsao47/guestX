<!-- Question 1
Our company needs to send out time sensitive and highly personal information to clientele.
Information cannot be a savable format at any time. So no emails, faxes, texts, or anything that
would leave a paper trail. How would you solve this problem and what technologies would you
use? What questions would you ask to further your solution or find a better solution? -->

I've thought about using blockchain to make our data more secure. However, since we cannot have a paper trail at anytime, I believe the most secure way would be to just have them call each other. This way, no data will be savable at anytime. No technologies I have researched so far can actually be secured enough without saving data in some sort of a format. To find a better solution, I would ask if the clients are willing to trust anyone with such information, so I can better find a technology to provide the clients a better service.
