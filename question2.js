// Represent a 6 string guitar (standard tuning, only the first 2 fret boards) and a 4 string bass
// (standard tuning, only the first 3 frets) in a class structure. Create attributes, elements, functions
// and any other components you feel they may have.
// 1. Consider where they are similar and where they are different.
// 2. Consider we want to identify if the note from one is equal to the other based on the fret
// position and string played.

// Please note this doesnâ€™t need to be an executable application , only a collection of classes that
// would represent the guitar , the bass in its commonality and its differences.
